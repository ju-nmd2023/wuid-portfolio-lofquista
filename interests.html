          <p class="violin">
            One of my main interests have always been music,
            and more specifically, playing the violin. 
            I have played the violin since I was 8 years old, both taking lectures and playing in orchestras. 
            Over the years I have got to play mostly classical music, but also pop, rock, modern and folkmusic.
            I do believe that my journey learning to play violin has given me a lot.
            From all the friends I have got, to the genuin joyfulness of
            sounding really good when playing together with others, 
            and the discipline of practicing and cooperate together.
            Music is something my whole family always have enjoyed 
            and I hope I get to continue my journey with music throughout the
            rest of my life.

          <h2 class="h2-football">Football and Floorball</h2>
          <p class="liverpool">
            Another big interest of mine that I believe I got from my family,
            and foremost from my father and brother, is sports.
            I used to play both football and floorball when I was younger, but
            now 
            I mostly watch in from the audience. Before quitting I was mostly
            interested in 
            playing myself, I did not really care what other teams did on TV.
            Now however, I have 
            grown to become quite fond of it and try to follow every game that
            Liverpool FC plays. 
            Why I have chosen to root for Liverpool is only an inherited thing
            from my father, 
            but I am thouroughly happy with it.

          <h2 class="h2-sports">Sports</h2>
          <p class="floorball">
            In all seriousness, sports have become a safe and happy place for
            me. 
            I do not know when this transition happened really, but for me it is
            
            a place for everyone to come together, no matter who you are. 
            A sports event is a place for expressing feelings, believing,
            hoping, and 
            finding a community. Although it might sound cliché, I can not
            describe the 
            satisfaction of living out all your feelings at a sports event.
            There you 
            can scream, laugh, cry, stress, jump out of excitement and just be
            utterly 
            and completely yourself. It does not matter who you are, everyone is
            welcome. 
            I know there are exceptions, but this is the base of sports and what
            it 
            should be, and that I do love.
